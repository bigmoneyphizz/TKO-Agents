# TKO-Agents
## Overview

**Tengoku Sōzō** is a production-grade AI agent runtime built by **ShugoTKO LLC**.
It is designed to execute **autonomous, monetizable AI agents** securely, deterministically, and at scale.

This is not a chatbot system.
It is an **agent execution platform**.

The core philosophy is:
> **Agents are products. Execution is infrastructure. Stability precedes scale.**

- Enforce deterministic JSON contracts
- Separate execution from UI, billing, and storage
- Support multiple AI engines (Workers AI now, OpenAI later)
- Convert audits → workflows → revenue
- Maintain strict security and cost controls
